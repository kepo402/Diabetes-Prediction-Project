# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains a simple web application for predicting diabetes using a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health-related features.

## Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-Project.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-app
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python and pip installed.

Run the application:

python app.py
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Usage
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

Enter the values for features n1 to n8 in the provided input fields.

Click the "Predict" button to see the model's prediction for diabetes.

Files and Directory Structure
app.py: The main script for running the web application.
templates/: Contains HTML templates for the web pages.
diabetes.csv: CSV file containing the diabetes dataset.
model.pkl: Serialized logistic regression model (not included in the repository due to size).
Note
Make sure to replace the placeholder your-username with your GitHub username if you fork or clone this repository.

The model.pkl file is not included in the repository due to its size. You can train the model using the provided diabetes.csv file and save the model using joblib or a similar library.

This is a basic example, and you may want to enhance the application with better styling, error handling, and more sophisticated features based on your use case.
